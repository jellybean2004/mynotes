- in the light emitted from gases, like hydrogen, the spectra are found to not be continuous, but consisting of specific wavelengths
- frequencies for $H$ atoms: $$\omega_{mn}= 2\pi\, R_{o}\,c \left( \frac{1}{n^{2}} - \frac{1}{m^{2}}\right)$$
	- where, $R_{o}$ is the rydberg constant, $n,m\in\mathbb Z$
- energy emitted from an atom is quantized if emitted by change of electron energy
- electrons must have only specific discrete energies
- atom's energies will follow: $$E_{n} = -\frac{2\pi\,R_{o}\hbar\,c}{n^{2}}$$
	where, $n\in\mathbb Z$
