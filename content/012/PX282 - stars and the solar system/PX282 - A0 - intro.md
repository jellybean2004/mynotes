### hydrostatic equilibrium
- a key aspects of stars and planets
- balance between gravity and pressure gradient
- basically, a body is massive enough that gravity can overcome its rigid body forces, and is round
- consider a shell within the planet/star with a thickness, $dr$, and a mass, $dm$, at a radius, $r$
- consider a small element within the shell having a mass, $M_{r}$ (a cylinder, with axis perpendicular to the surface, faces aligned along the surfaces of the shell)
- gravitational force, $$F_{G}= \frac{G\, M_{r}\, dm}{r^{2}}\,...(1)$$
	- $dm = \rho(r)\, dr\,dA$
		where, $\rho(r)$ is the density, $dA$ is the area of the cylinder's circular surface
- due to pressure: $$F_{P} = \rho(r)\,dA-\rho(r+dr)\,dA = -dP\,dA\,...(2)$$
- from equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, the **hydrostatic equilibrium equation**: $$\frac{dP}{dr}= - \frac{G\, M_{r}\,\rho(r)}{r^{2}}$$
- can be used to solve for the interior structure of a star/planet
	- eg: $\rho(r)$, if $P(\rho)$ is known, ie: *the equation of state*

## what is a star?
- a body bound by self-gravity
- radiates energy from an internal source
- massive enough for nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms

- *this is a working definition, details are complex*

- the baseline of the knowledge of stars comes from the sun
	- spherical(ish), ie: self-bound
	- the effective temperature, $T_{eff}\approx 5780\,K$
	- the radius, $R_{\odot}\approx 4\times10^{8}\,m\approx110\,R_{\oplus}$
	- the mass, $M_{\odot}=2\times10^{30}\,kg\approx1.7B\,M_{\oplus}$
	- age $\approx4.6\,Gyr$ (from the age of the oldest moon rocks)
	- rotation period $\approx 27\,days$
	$$\begin{align*}	a^{2}&= c^{2}\\	c^{2}&= d^{2}\end{align*}	$$
