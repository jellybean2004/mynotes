## Q1
- *In the Earth’s early history, the Sun’s luminosity is thought to have been only $70\%$ of the present day value (owing to a higher ratio of hydrogen to helium in its core). Calculate the temperature of the early Sun.*
- [[PX158 - F1 - black body radiation#stefan-boltzmann law|stefan-boltzmann law]] : $$L_{\odot}\propto T_{eff}^{4}$$
$$T_{eff} = \sqrt[4]{0.7}\,T_{eff,\,now} \approx 5305\,K$$
## Q2
- What is the peak wavelength of this early Sun? What colour would it appear relative to the present Sun?
- [[PX158 - F1 - black body radiation#wien's law|wien's law]] : $$\lambda_{max}T = 2.9\times10^{-3}\implies \lambda_{max,\,\odot} = 546.7\,nm$$
## Q3
- *The bright star Antares has a measured colour of $(B-V)=1.83$, while our Sun has a colour of $(B-V)=0.65$. State, with reasons, whether Antares is hotter or cooler than our Sun. What does this tell us about the luminosity of Antares?*
- Antares is *redder* than the sun $\implies$ cooler than the sun
## Q4
- *Using the definition of effective temperature $T_{eff}$ from the lectures, calculate the luminosities of the following stars in terms of solar luminosities:
	(a) A white dwarf with $R = 0.01 R_{\odot}$ and $T_{eff} = 25 000\,K$
	(b) A red giant with $R = 100 R_{\odot}$ and $T_{eff} = 3000\,K$.
	(The effective temperature of the Sun $T_{eff,\,\odot} = 5800\,K$.)*
- [[PX158 - F1 - black body radiation#stefan-boltzmann law|stefan-boltzmann law]] : $$L = 4\pi\sigma R^{2}L^{4} \implies \frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{R}{R_{\odot}}\right)^{2}$$
$$\therefore L_{WD} \approx 0.035 \,L_{\odot}$$
$$L_{giant\;star} \approx 716\,L_{\odot}$$
## Q5
- *A neutron star has radius, $R = 10\,km$ and luminosity, $L = 0.5\,L_{\odot}$. Calculate (i) its effective temperature, and (ii) the wavelength of maximum flux density in its spectrum, assuming that the star radiates as a black-body.*
- [[PX158 - F1 - black body radiation#stefan-boltzmann law|stefan-boltzmann law]] : $$T_{eff}= \left(\frac{L}{4\pi\sigma R^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \approx 1.28\times10^{6}\,K$$
- [[PX158 - F1 - black body radiation#wien's law|wien's law]] : $$\lambda_{max}\approx 2.3\,nm$$
- *What would be the best region of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the neutron star?*
- X-rays
## Q6
- *Jupiter’s moon Io orbits $421 600\,km$ from the centre of Jupiter with a period of $1.77\,d$. Calculate the mass of Jupiter. (You may neglect Io’s mass compared to that of Jupiter.)*
$$\frac{4\pi^{2}}{P^{2}} = \frac{G(m_{1}+m_{2})}{R^{3}}$$
- $m_{jup}>>m_{io} \implies (m_{jup}+m_{io})\approx m_{jup}$: $$m_{jup}\approx 1.9\times10^{27}\,kg$$
## Q7
- *Spectra of a star of mass $0.8M_{\odot}$ show, through the Doppler effect, that it has an orbital speed of $17\,ms^{−1}$ owing to a planet orbiting it on a period of $7\,yr$. Calculate the mass of the planet.) Use the small mass of the planet compared to the star to make approximations to help your calculations.)*
- *In practice the Doppler effect only gives the component of stellar velocity along our line of sight to the target. In most cases it is not possible to determine the orientation of orbits with respect to the line of sight. Show that this will cause us to underestimate the masses of planets found in this manner.*
- $m_{s}>>m_{p} \implies (m_{s}+m_{p})\approx m_{s}$: $$m_{p}\approx 1.87\times10^{27}\,kg$$
## Q8
- Two stars in a binary of orbital period $2.7\,hr$ have orbital speeds of $65 km s^{−1}$ and $350 km s^{−1}$. Calculate the masses of the two stars.
$$M_{1}= 0.7\,M_{\odot}\;;\; M_{2}= 0.13\,M_{\odot}$$
