## Q1
- *A star at a distance of $d = 135\,pc$ has an apparent magnitude, $m = 17.5$. What is its absolute magnitude?*
$$\begin{align*}
	m-M &= 5\log_{10}\left(\frac{d}{10\,pc}\right) \\
	M &= 11.8
\end{align*}$$
## Q2
- *The faintest objects ever detected at optical wavelengths have apparent magnitudes, $m = 31$. Calculate the flux from an object of this magnitude, and convert your result into a photon flux (i.e. the number of photons per unit time per unit area at Earth).*
- let object 1 be the faint star and object 2 be the sun: $$\begin{align*}
		m_{1}- m_{2} &= -2.5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}\right) \\
		\frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}&= 10^{-\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{2.5}} \\
		&= 10^{-\frac{31-(-26.8)}{2.5}} \\
		f_{1} &= 1350 \times 10^{-\frac{31-(-26.8)}{2.5}} \\
		&= 10^{-20}\, W\,m^{-2} \\ 
		\therefore f_{1} &= 0.025\, photons\,s^{-1}\,m^{-2}
	\end{align*}$$
- *On $Jan\, 23, 1999$ a remarkable gamma-ray burst (GRB) briefly peaked at $m = 9$ despite being some $3 Gpc = 3 × 10^{9}\, pc$ from Earth. Calculate its luminosity as a multiple of the Sun’s luminosity.*
$$\begin{align*}
	m-M &= 5\log_{10} \left(\frac{d}{10\,pc}\right) \\
	M &= -33.4
\end{align*}$$
$$\begin{align*}
	m_{1}-m_{2}&= -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}\right) \\
	M_{1}-M_{2}&= -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L_{1}}{L_{2}}\right) \\
	\therefore L_{1} &= 2\times10^{15}L_{\odot}	
\end{align*}$$
## Q4
- *A lens of diameter, $D = 100\,mm$ and focal length, $f = 200\,mm$ is used to focus an image of the Sun onto a piece of paper. What is the size of the Sun’s image and what is the incident power per unit area within the image?*
$$l = f\,\alpha = 200\times 30\times \frac{\pi}{60\times180} \,mm = 1.8\,mm$$
$$\frac{P}{A} = 1350 \left(\frac{\pi\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^{2}}{\pi\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^{2}}\right)= 4\times10^{6}\,W\,m^{-2}$$
## Q5
- *A star changes brightness by $+1$ magnitude. What is the corresponding change in its flux?*
$$m_{1}-m_{2} = -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}\right)$$
- factor of $0.4$ in flux
## Q6
- *A star’s flux increase by a factor $2$. What is the corresponding change in its magnitude?*
$$\Delta m = -0.75$$
## Q7
- *Calculate the total absolute magnitude of a star cluster containing of $500 000$ Sun-like stars.*
- $M_{\odot}= +4.8$
$$M=-9.45$$
## Q8
- *Show that an increase of ${} 1\%$ in brightness corresponds to a magnitude change $∆m \approx −0.01$*
$$m_{1}-m_{2} = -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}\right)$$
## Q10
- *A star brightens by a factor of *2.3* in flux measured through a B filter, and at the same time by *1.5* in flux measured through a *V* filter. Calculate the change in its $B − V$ colour.*
$$\Delta B = -2.5\log_{10}(2.3) = -0.904$$
$$\Delta V = -2.5\log_{10}(1.5) = -0.44$$
$$\therefore B-V = \Delta B - \Delta V = -0.464$$
## Q11
- *The daytime sky brightness on a cloudless day when the Sun is well above the horizon is roughly equivalent to a star of magnitude $3.5\,per\,square\,arcsecond$. Use this to estimate the limiting magnitude of stars and planets for them to be visible in the daytime ($(i)$ by unaided eye, $(ii)$ by eye with the aid of a telescope. (Assume that the target flux has to exceed $10\%$ of the background flux, with the patch of background a square equal on each side to the minimum resolvable angle in each case.)*
