- an object with spatial extent, ${} l$, at a distance, $d$
	$\tan\alpha = \frac{l}{d}$ , $\alpha$ in radians
$$\tan\alpha = \alpha + \frac{1}{3}\alpha^{3} + \frac{2}{15}\alpha^{5}+...$$
- for small $\alpha$, $\tan\alpha \approx \alpha$: $$\therefore \alpha = \frac{l}{d}$$
	- $l$ and $d$ must be in the same units; $\alpha$ in radians

	$p=$ angle of parallax
	$d >> 1AU$
	$$d = \frac{1 \, AU}{p}$$
		where, $p$ is in $arc\,seconds$ , and $d$ will be in $parsecs$
- *parsec* = *par*allax-arc*sec*ond
- in 1836, bessel measured the parallax for a star called "61 Cyg", and found $p=0.31^{"}$: $$d = \frac{1}{0.31} \approx 3.2 \, pc$$
