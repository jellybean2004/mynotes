## planck's law
- all bodies emit thermal radiation
- a black body absorbs perfectly at all wavelengths
- for a black body, the wavelength, $\lambda$, of the emitted radiation can be specified
- in 1901, max planck found a function and model that accurately gave the spectrum of  black body.
- power per area per $\lambda:$ $$B_\lambda(T) = \frac{2\pi hc^{2}}{\lambda^{5}(e^{\frac{hc}{k_{B}T\lambda}}-1)}$$ **nimp**

- "rayleigh-jeans tail" can be obtained from classical physics
- smooth curves
- steep cut off at wien tail (short $\lambda$)
- slow decrease at rayleigh jeans tails (long $\lambda$)
- higher temperature objects will have higher $B_{\lambda}$ at all $\lambda$
- peak shifts to red end as temperature decreases
## wien's law
- gives the peak wavelength for any given temperature: $$\lambda_{max}T = 2.9\times10^{-3}m\,K$$
- wien's constant $= 2.9\times10^{-3} m\,K$

- eg: what is the peak wavelength for emission from the earth?
	- $T=290\,K$
	$$\lambda_{max} = \frac{2.9\times10^{-3}}{290} = 10^{-5}\,m = 10\,\mu m$$
## stefan-boltzmann law
- total power emitted per unit area ($J$) is given by: $$J = \sigma\,T^{4}$$ where, $\sigma=5.67\times10^{-8}\,Wm^{-2}K^{-4}:$ stefan-boltzmann constant

- eg: what is the power emitted by a person?
	- $T=310\,K$, $S.A.=2\,m^{2}$
	$$P = 5.67\times10^{-8} \times(310)^{4} \times 2 \approx 1000\,W$$
