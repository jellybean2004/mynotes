## alt/az grid
- for a local observer
- *altitude* is defined as:
	$0\degree = horizon$
	$90\degree = directly \; overhead$
- *meridian* is the north-south line for any observer

- objects reach the maximum altitude as they cross the meridian

$\delta=Dec$ , $\phi =$ latitude of the observer
$$maximum \; altitude = 90\degree - (\phi-\delta)$$
	for $\delta < \phi$
$$maximum \; altitude = 90\degree + (\phi-\delta)$$
	for $\delta > \phi$
	
- eg: what is the maximum altitude for the sun at the winter solstice from coventry?
	- at winter solstice, $Dec = -23.5\degree$ : $$alt_{max} = 90\degree - (52 - 23.5)\degree = 14.5 \degree$$

- this method can be used to find the observer's longitude if the declination and the maximum altitude of an object for the observer is known
- the altitude of an object in the sky can be measured using a *sextant*
- the latitude can be determined using a very accurate clock
