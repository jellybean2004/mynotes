- the *"celestial sphere"* is a way of mapping the *position* and *movement* of stars, sun, moon, planets, etc
- a reference grid similar to latitude and longitude on earth is used
	- ***right ascension (R.A.)***
		- equivalent to longitude
		- $0$ to $360 \degree$, sometimes $0$ to $24 \,h$
	- ***declination (Dec.)***
		- equivalent to latitude
		- $-90\degree$ to $+90\degree$

- it can be observed that all the stars in the night sky rotate about a point called the *celestial pole* (approximately polaris for the northern hemisphere)
- it rotates once per day
- the positions of stars in the reference grid remain unchanged
- the positions of the sun and the planets change throughout the year. 
- the sun move along the great circle called the *ecliptic*, and the planets move very close to it. the moon also moves very close to it
- the position of the sun for the northern hemisphere:
	- at the vernal equinox ($21^{st} march$): 
		$RA = 0\degree$ 
		$Dec = 0\degree$
	- at the summer solstice ($21^{st} june$):
		$RA = 90\degree$ 
		$Dec = +23.5\degree$
	- at the autumn equinox ($23^{rd}september$): 
		$RA = 180\degree$ 
		$Dec = 0\degree$
	- at the winter solstice ($21^{st} december$): 
		$RA = 270\degree$ 
		$Dec = -23.5\degree$
- the sun rises and sets due east and west respectively on the equinoxes, and at the extreme north/south positions on the solstices
