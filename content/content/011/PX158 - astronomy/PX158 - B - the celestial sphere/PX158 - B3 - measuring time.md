## a day
- ***sidereal day*** : a full rotation of the earth $\approx 23 \,h \; 56\,min$
- ***solar day*** : time taken for the sun to return to the same part of the sky $\equiv 24 \,hours$ 
	- for the solar day to be equal to the sidereal day, it must be: $\frac{24}{365}\,hours \approx 4\, mins$ longer

## calendars
### the sumerians
- a calendar with $360\,days = 12\,months \times 30\,days$
- introduced a leap month every four years to make up for the true length of the year $\approx 365.25\,days$
### the romans
- introduced *the julian calendar*, which had $365\,days$ a year
- added a leap day every four years
- but the earth's orbital period is $365.24219\,days$
### the present
- in $1582$, pope gregory introduced a modification whereby some leap days are skipped to make up for the difference â€” *the gregorian calendar*
- not all countries adopted this at the same time, resulting in differences of $10\,days$ in different systems
