- the orbital velocities appear constant right out to the limit of observations
- most of the mass is "unseen", known as "*dark matter*"
- stars are on circular orbits, balance force from gravity with centripetal force: $$\begin{align*}
		\frac{GMm_{s}}{R^{2}} &= \frac{m_{s}v^{2}}{R} \\
		M &= \frac{v^{2}R}{G}
	\end{align*}$$
- eg: mass interior to the orbit of the sun in milky way:
	- $v_{\odot}=230\,kms^{-1}$, $R_{\odot}=8\,kpc$
	$$M_{MW} \approx 10^{11}M_{\odot}$$
- stars at the edge of the galaxy show similar velocities, giving $$M_{MW}\approx 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$$
- this is far in excess of all *baryonic matter*

- there lies a *supermassive blackhole* (*SMBH*) in the centre of most galaxies
- eg: $M84$ shows $v\approx400\,kms^{-1}$ at $R=8\,pc$
	$$M\approx 2\times10^{8}\,M_\odot$$

- in $2019$, *SMBH* was observed in radio spectrum
