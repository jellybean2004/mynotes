- consists of cores from stars that have finished fusion
- *pauli's exclusion principle*: no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state
- *the [[PX156 - B3 - de broglie hypothesis#^e4a50f|de broglie wavelength]]* gives the mean spacing between the electrons: $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = n_{e}^{- \frac{1}{3}}$$
		where, $n_{e}=$ number density of electrons
- the degeneracy energy: $$E_{d} = \frac{p^{2}}{2m_{e}} = \frac{h^{2}n_{e}^{\frac{2}{3}}}{2m_{e}}$$
- **key features:**
	- there is no temperature dependence
	- $E\propto \frac{1}{m}$ means electrons have much higher degeneracy energy for similar $n$ than protons or neutrons

- if a box of degenerate electrons is compressed, $n_{e}$, and therefore $E_{d}$ would increase
- therefore work needs to be performed 
- **degenerate electrons exert a pressure*
- this pressure supports white dwarfs
- electrons are stripped from the carbon and oxygen nuclei
- nuclei provide most of the mass, and electrons, most of the pressure

- $R_{WD}\approx R_{\oplus}$, $M_{WD} \approx 0.6\,M_{\odot}$ , and $\rho_{WD}= 10^{9}\,kgm^{-3}$
- white dwarves have very strong gravitational fields, and can accrete material
- they convert accreted mass to radiation (energy) with a $15\%$ efficiency (*cf*: $H$-fusion: $0.7\%$)
