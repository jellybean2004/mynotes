- all thermally supported stars must have a finite lifetime since they lose heat. they must be using up 'fuel'
- *all stars must die*
$$t = \frac{E}{L_{s}}$$
	$E=$ total energy available
## chemical energy
- considering *chemical energy*, for $H$, electrons have an energy $\sim 13.6\,eV$
- assuming that a star is entirely composed of $H: E_{c}= \frac{M_{\odot}}{M_{H}} \times 13.6 eV \approx 2.6\times10^{39}\,J$
$$t_{C}= \frac{E_{c}}{L_{s}} \approx 220\,000\,years$$
- this is not realistic
## nuclear energy
- considering *fusion energy*, $\sim 7\,MeV\,per\,H$
- the source of stellar energy must be from nuclear energy, in particular, $H$ fusion

- $H\to He$ fusion${} :0.7\%$ mass$\to$energy$:E= 0.007\,M_{\odot}c^{2}\approx 1.3\times10^{45}\,J$
$$t_{f} \approx 100\,Gyr$$
- this assumes that the entire mass fuses, but only the core$(\sim12\%)$ is fused
- actual lifetime of the sun is $\sim12\,Gyr$
