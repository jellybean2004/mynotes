*dotted lines represent short timespans

- $1\to2: H\to He$ fusion in the core
	- most of the sun's life

- $2\to3:$ red giant phase
	- $H$ depleted in the core
	- $H$ starts to fuse in a shell around the core

- $3\to4:$ horizontal branch phase
	- $T\sim10^{8}\,K$ in the core
	- $He$ starts to fuse in the core into $C/O$
	- reaction $\propto T^{40}$

- $4\to5:$ asymptotic giant branch (*AGB*)
	- $He$ depleted in the core
	- the core is $C/O$
	- $He$ fusion in a shell around the core
	- $H$ fusion in a shell around the $He$ shell

- $5\to6:$ the star's envelope is lost to space, forming a *planetary nebula* (*PN*)
	- *white dwarf:* $C/O$ with a thin atmosphere of $He/H$
	- $M_{WD}\approx 0.6\,M_{\odot}$
