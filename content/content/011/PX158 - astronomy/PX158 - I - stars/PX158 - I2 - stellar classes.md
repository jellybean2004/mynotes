## main-sequence
- star is fusing hydrogen in its core
- covers the majority of a star's lifetime: $\sim Myr \to 100-1000\,Gyr$
- the sun will be in the main-sequence for $\sim12\,Gyr$
- using [[PX158 - F2 - luminosity-temperature-radius of stars|luminosity-temperature-radius of stars relation]], $R_{s}\approx 0.1\,R_{\odot}\to 10\,R_{\odot}$
## red giant
- after hydrogen in the core has depleted, helium fusion begins
- star expands and outer layers cool
- for the sun, $R_{\odot,\;red\,giant}\approx 1\,AU$
- $R_{RG}\approx 10\,R_{\odot}\to1500\,R_{\odot}$
- a star will not spend much time in this phase
- for the sun, it will be about $1\,Gyr$
## white dwarf
- the end states of most main-sequence stars
- $T_{WD} \sim 25,000\,K\to3000\,K$
- $R_{WD}\sim 0.01\,R_{\odot}\approx R_{\oplus}$
- in an isolated state, they remain in this state
