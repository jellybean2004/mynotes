- most binaries cannot be spatially resolved
- however, in many cases, they can be resolved spectroscopically
- the two stars will have different emission spectra 
- the velocity of the stars can be measured by the doppler shift of the lines
- assuming circular orbit: $$v_{1} = \frac{2\pi r_{1}}{P} \;;\; v_{2}= \frac{2\pi r_{2}}{P}$$
- the *[[PX154 - G6 - the doppler effect|doppler shift]]* is given by: $$\lambda = \lambda_{0} (1 + \frac{v_{RV}}{c})$$
		where, $\lambda=$ observed wavelength, $\lambda_{0}=$ rest wavelength, $v_{RV}=$ radial velocity
	- $v_{RV} << c$
- the *inclination* of the binary star orbit is given by $i$
	- $i=90\degree:$ edge on $\implies v_{RV} =v$
	- $i=0\degree:$ face on $\implies v_{RV} =0$

- consider an observer is edge  a binary system, ie: $i=90\degree$, and star 1 is revolving about the centre of mass in the anticlockwise direction
	- $(a): \theta=0:$ star 1 is closest to the observer and the velocity is perpendicular to the line of sight
	- $(b): \theta=\frac{\pi}{2}:$ star 1 is moving away from the observer with maximum (positive) radial velocity
	- $(c): \theta=\pi$ star 1 is furthest from the observer and the velocity is perpendicular to the line of sight
	- $(d): \theta=\frac{3\pi}{4}:$ star 1 is moving towards the observer with minimum (negative) radial velocity

- for eclipsing binaries, $i\sim 90$
- as $i\to0$, the amplitude will decrease given by $\sin i$
- the motion of a binary star through the galaxy can be seen as a constant velocity ($\gamma$)
$$v_{RV} = \gamma_{RV} + v_{1}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P} (t-T_{0})\right) \sin i$$
- if $i$ is unknown, $m = m_{1}\sin{i}$
- only a minimum mass can be obtained
