- general relativity predicts that light will bend in a gravitational field
- the angle of deflection due to gravitational lensing, $\alpha$, by a mass, $M:$ $$\alpha = \frac{4GM}{c^{2}r}$$ nimp
- the angle of deflection for light from a star near the limb of the sun: $$\Delta\alpha = 1.73^{''}$$
- in $1919$, measurements were made that helped prove general relativity

- *einstien ring radius*: $$\theta_{E} = \sqrt{\frac{4\,G\,M}{c^{2}\,D}}$$
	where, $M=$ mass of gravitational lens object, $D =$ observer-lens distance $=$ lens-source distance
- **note:** need perfect alignment

- **micro-lensing:** $M\sim M_{\odot}, \; D\sim kpc \implies \theta_{E}\sim milli-arcseconds$
- not spatially resolvable, but magnification can be seen in brightness

- **galaxy-galaxy gravitational lensing:** $M\sim M_{galaxy},\; D\sim Mpc\implies \theta_{E}\sim arcseconds$

- $M\sim M_{galacy\;cluster},\; D\sim \frac{1}{2}D_{observable\;universe} \implies \theta\sim arcminutes$
