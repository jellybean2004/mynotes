- this is an expansion of the space-time itself, not an explosion

- $H$, $He$ and some $Li$ were formed a the universe cooled
- stars formed the other elements, up to $Fe$, via [[PX158 - I5a - pressure at the centre of stars|nuclear fusion]] 
- elements heavier than $Fe$ were produced via supernovae and *kilonovae* (NS-NS/NS-BH merges)

- the big bang can explain the large scale structures in the universe, eg: galaxy voids, filaments, etc
- need *dark matter* to do this
- this dark matter has to be slow moving, *cold dark matter* (CDM)
