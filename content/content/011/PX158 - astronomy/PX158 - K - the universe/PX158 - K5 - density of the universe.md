- assuming that the universe is close to a *critical density* ($\rho_{c}$): $$\begin{align*}
		\frac{1}{2}mv_{c}^{2} &= \frac{GMm}{R} \\
		v_{c}^{2}&= \frac{2GM}{R} \\\\
		v_{c} &= H_{0}R \\
		M &= \frac{4}{3}\pi R^{3}\rho_{c} \\\\
		H_{0}^{2}R^{2} &= \frac{8}{3}\pi R^{2}G\rho_{c} \\
		\rho_{c} &= \frac{3 H_{0}^{2}}{8\pi G} \\
		&= 9.47\times10^{-27}\,kg\,m^{-3} \\
		&\approx 6\,H\,atoms\,m^{-3}
	\end{align*}$$
	where, $M=$ mass of the universe in a sphere of radius, $R$ ; $v_{c}=$ critical recessional velocity

- the calculated value is about twenty times higher than the actual density as observed (baryonic matter)
- therefore, only $\sim5\%$ of $\rho_{c}$ is baryonic, $25\%$ is dark matter, $70\%$ is unknown

- in the $1990s$, astronomers found '*dark energy*' existed from supernova surveys, which can account for the $70\%$ of $\rho_{c}$
- this is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate
