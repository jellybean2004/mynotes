- an expanding universe implies a finite age
- assuming that $H_{0}$ is constant in time, the lifetime of the universe is: $$t_{0}= \frac{d}{v} =\frac{1}{H_{0}}$$
- if $H_{0}=72\,km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}:$ $$t_{0}\approx 13.6\,Gyr$$
- a more precise calculation, which uses the cosmological evolution model, can be made that allows $H_{0}$ to vary in time: $$t_{0}\approx 13.8\,Gyr$$
