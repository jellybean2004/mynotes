- in $1929$, Hubble found that the radial velocity of galaxies increased with distance
- these velocities are almost always red shifts, ie: galaxies are moving away
$$v = H_{0}\,d$$
	where, $H_{0}=$ hubble's constant
- $v$ was measured by observing shifts in atomic absorprtion/emission lines in galaxy spectrum
- the best fit line gives: $$H_{0}= 72\,km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}$$
- this implied that the universe is expanding
- the expansion is space-time itself, not an explosion into space
- the expansion can be measured by using a term called redshift: $$1+z = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{0}}$$
		where, $\lambda=$ apparent wavelength, $\lambda_{0}=$ rest wavelength
	- $z=0:$ local
	- $z\sim0.1:$ local universe
	- $z>1:$ high-redshift universe
$$v = c\,z$$
	where, $v=$ recessional velocity

- eg: *if  galaxy shows features at $498\,nm$, $\lambda_{0}=486\,nm$, what is $z,\;v,\;d$ and apparent magnitude of a cepheid variable with $M=-7$?*
	$$\begin{align*}
		1-z = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{0}} &\implies z \approx 0.0247 \\
		v = cz &\approx 7\,400\,km\,s^{-1} \\
		v=H_{0}d &\implies d=103\,Mpc \\
		m-M=5\log_{10}\left(\frac{d}{10\,pc}\right) &\implies m=28.1
	\end{align*}$$
	- the apparent magnitude is very faint (to even be detected by a telescope)
