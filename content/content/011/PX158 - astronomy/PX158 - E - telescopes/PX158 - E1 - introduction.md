- the light gathering power is proportional to the collecting area of the telescope (aperture)

- human eye pupil, $d\approx5\,mm$
- giant squid pupil, $d\approx 90\,mm$
- difference in light gathering power: $$\Delta = \frac{\pi r_{squid}^{2}}{\pi r_{human}^{2}} \approx 18^{2} = 324$$
## types of telescopes
### refracting telescope
![[Pasted image 20240124123106.png]]
- the lens is hard to make perfectly, and imperfections cause image distortions
- also difficult to make a lens that works over a wide wavelength range
### reflecting telescope

- a parabolic mirror design is needed, which can be produced more easily and larger than lenses
### combination

- the large mirror can be spherical, which is much easier to produce
## cameras

- using small angle approximation: $$\alpha= \frac{l}{f}$$
