- metallic core (chiefly iron and nickel)
- mantle composed of silicates

## outer planets
- lower density, composed of hydrogen and helium
- metallic ($Fe,\, Ni$) and silicate core
- jupiter has a liquid hydrogen shell around its core
- primary atmosphere (gases accumulated during formation) of ammonia, carbon dioxide, and methane
