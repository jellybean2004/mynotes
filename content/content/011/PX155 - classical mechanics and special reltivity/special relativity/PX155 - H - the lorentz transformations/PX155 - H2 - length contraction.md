- consider a rod at rest in frame $S'$ along the $x'$ axis. two ends at $x_{A}'$ and $x_{B}'$
- length of rod is $x_{B}'-x_{A}'=L'$
- in frame a $S$, the rod is moving at $+u$, so, it must measure $x_A$ and $x_B$ at the same time, otherwise not the same length
		$x_{A}' = \gamma(x_{A}-ut)$
		$x_{B}' = \gamma(x_{B}-ut)$
		$L' = x_{B}'-x_{A}' = \gamma (x_{B}-ut)-\gamma(x_{A}-ut) = \gamma L$
	- for a rod at rest in $S$: $$\therefore L' = \gamma L$$
- what if the rod is at rest in $S$?
		$x_{A} = \gamma(x_{A}'+ut')$
		$x_{B} = \gamma(x_{B}'+ut')$
	- ***NB***: must be measured at the same $t'$
		$L = x_{B} -x_{A} = \gamma(x_{A}'+ut') - \gamma(x_{B}'+ut') = \gamma L'$
	- for a rod at rest in $S$: $$\therefore L' = L/\gamma$$
- define $L_{0}$ as "*proper length*" as length in the rest frame of the rod. $L_{u}$ as length in the frame where the rod moves at $u$
- length contraction: $$L_{u} = \frac{L_{0}}{\gamma}$$
	- the direction of $u$ doesn't matter as $L_{u}$ depends on $u^{2}$

- eg: our galaxy is $~100,000$ light years across its own rest frame. to an UHECR proton with $\gamma= 5\times 10^{10}$, the galaxy is contracting
	- $L_{u} = \frac{L_{0}}{\gamma} = \frac{9.5\times10^{20}}{5\times10^{10}} = 1.9\times10^{10}m \approx 13\%$ of the earth-sun distance
