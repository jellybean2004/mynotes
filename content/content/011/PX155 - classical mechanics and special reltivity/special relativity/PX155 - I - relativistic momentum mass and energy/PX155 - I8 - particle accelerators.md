- $E^{2}-p^{2}c^{2}$ is *lorentz invariant*, and conserved in collisions because $E$ and $p$ are conserved

- eg: a particle of rest mass, $m_{0}=1 GeV/c^{2}$ , is accelerated to a total energy, $E=100 GeV$, and collided with an identical but stationary particle. calculate the rest mass of the new particle created from these two particles
	- conserving energy: $E_{f} = E_{0} + E$
	- conserving momentum: $p_{f}=p$
	- $$M_{0}^{2}c^{4} = E_{f}^{2}-p_{f}^{2}c^{2} = (E_{0}+E)^{2}-p_{f}^{2}c^{2}$$
	- we have $E_{0}^{2} = E^{2}-p^{2}c^{2}$ : $$M_{0}^{2}c^{4}= 2E_{0}^{2}+ 2E_{0}E $$
	$$\therefore E_{0f} = M_{0}c^{2}= \sqrt{2 \times 1 + 2 \times 100 \times 1} = 14.2 Gev/c^{2}$$
