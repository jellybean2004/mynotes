- two particles having the same mass, $m$, have a totally inelastic head on collision, and coalesce to form a new particle of mass, $M$
- let $v_{1}'=u$ , so, $v_{2}'=-u$
- in $S$ before collision: $$v_{1} = \frac{v_{1}'+u}{1+ \frac{uv_{1}'}{c^{2}}} = \frac{2u}{1+ \frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}$$ $$and, \;v_{2}= \frac{v_{2}'+u}{1+ \frac{uv_{2}'}{c^{2}}}=0$$
- let $v=v_{1}$
- momentum in $S$ : 
	- before: $$p_{i} = mv = \frac{2mu}{1+ \frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}$$
	- after: $$p_{f} = Mu = 2mu$$
	- we see that $p_{i}\neq p_{f}$
