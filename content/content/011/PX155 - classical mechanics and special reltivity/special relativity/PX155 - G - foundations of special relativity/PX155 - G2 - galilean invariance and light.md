## problem
- maxwell unified electricity and magnetism, published in 1865, and showed that *light is a wave with a unique speed*: $$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}}$$
- galilean transformations: pulse of light moving along x-axis of $S'$ with $v'=c$ has $v=u+c$
## the luminiferous aether (debunked)
- maxwell's theory works in a special frame in which some light transmitting medium called *the luminiferous aether* is stationary
- all other observers will measure speed of light as $v = c \pm \delta$
	- $\delta$ depends on the direction of light compared to the direction of motion though aether
## michelson-morely experiment

- light from $S$ is split into two beans: $O\to A \to O$ and $O \to B \to O$
- any difference in round trip time is due to the the difference in $L_1$ and $L_2$, and the differences in the speed of light
- so, interference fringes can be observed at $D$
- rotate $90\degree$, expect to shift
- zero shift to within $\pm 0.1$ of a fringe was, measured
- therefore, it was proved that speed of light is the same in all directions, and galilean transformations don't apply
