- 3 observers, all at rest in frame $S'$. $B$ sends light pulses to $A$ and $C$ at the same time. $E_{A}$, and $E_{B}$ represent events of the light pulses reaching $A$, and $B$ respectively
- *space-time diagram* in $S'$
	- ![[Pasted image 20231115222247.png]]
	- light covers a distance, $\Delta x' = ct'$, after time, $t$, so, *world line* of light pulses is at $\pm45\degree$ from the x-axis. $A$, $B$, and $C$ have constant $x$
	- events $E_{A}$, and $E_{B}$ are simultaneous
- now consider some process in $S$
	- ![[Pasted image 20231115222629.png]]
	- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are moving, so, *world lines are at an angle* 
	- light still has world lines at $\pm 45\degree$, as per **RP2**
	- times of $E_{A}$, and $E_{B}$ are different $\implies t=t'$ is no longer true
