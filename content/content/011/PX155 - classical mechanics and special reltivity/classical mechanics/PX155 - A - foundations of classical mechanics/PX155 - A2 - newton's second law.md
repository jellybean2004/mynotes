- basis:
	- mass is a property that "resists" acceleration (mass measures "inertia")
	- define momentum $p = mv$
- *"the rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the total external force acting upon it"*
or
- *"force equals rate of  change of momentum"* $$F = \frac{dp}{dt}$$
- if mass ($m$) is constant (can be approximated as such)
 $$F = m \frac{dv}{dt} = ma$$
- *example 1.1:* 
	an oil tanker with mass(m) = $500,000 t$
	engine is the propeller exerting a force(F) = $5 \times 10^{6}N$ 
	how long does it take to reach $5ms^{-1}$ from rest?
		$a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{5 \times 10^{6}}{5 \times 10^{8}} = 10^{-2}ms^{-1}$
		v=u+at
		$5 = 0 + 10^{-2}t$
		$\therefore t=500s$
