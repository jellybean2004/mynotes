$$\vec L = \vec r \times \vec p = rmv \vec k = mr^{2}\omega \vec k$$
$$L = |\vec L| = mr^{2}\omega$$
- kinetic energy, $T = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}= \frac{1}{2}mr^{2}\omega ^{2}$
- define $I = mr^{2}$ as *"moment of inertia"*
$$\vec L = I \vec\omega$$ and $$T = \frac{1}{2}I
\omega^{2}$$
- $I$ could be taken as the angular counter part of mass $m$, *but* unlike $m$, $I$ depends on the axis of rotation
- **note**: $\vec L = I \vec\omega$ is not a general result
	- $I\vec\omega \neq \vec r \times \vec p$ if:
		- plane of rotation doesn't contain the origin of $\vec r$
		- origin isn't the centre of rotation
