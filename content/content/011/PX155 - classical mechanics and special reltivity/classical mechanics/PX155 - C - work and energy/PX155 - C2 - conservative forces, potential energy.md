## conservative forces
- work done is independent of the path
	- 'conservative' as in energy conserving

- conservative if $$\int_A^B \vec F d\vec r \;|_P=\int_A^B \vec F d\vec r\;|_{P'}$$
- here,	$$\int_A^B \vec F d\vec r\;|_P+\int_B^A \vec F d\vec r\;|_{P'}=0$$
- this can be written as, $$\oint \vec F d\vec r = 0$$
	- means that the path is a closed loop
- work done in reaching any point $P$ from an origin $O$ depends only on the position of $P$
- define a function $U=-W(O \to P)$ and set $U(0)=0$, where $U$ is the potential energy
	- $W(A\to B)=W(A\to 0)+W(0\to B)= U(A)-U(B)$
		$=-[U(B)-U(A)]$
		$=-\Delta U$
	- $W(A\to B)$ is also $\Delta T$
		$\Delta T=-\Delta U$
		$\Delta T + \Delta U = 0$
			$\therefore T+U$, AKA total mechanical energy, is constant/conserved provided that forces act as conservative
## deriving a force from a potential
- since $dW=F(x)dx=-dU$
	- in 1D: $$F(x)=-\frac{dU}{dx}$$
	- in 3D: $$\vec F=-\nabla U=-\frac{\delta U}{\delta x}\vec i-\frac{\delta U}{\delta y}\vec j-\frac{\delta U}{\delta x}\vec k$$

- consider $U=mgh$ 
	- $F(h)= -\frac{dU}{dh}=-mg$
		- acts downwards
		- increases $T$, decreases $U$
- consider $U=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$
	- $F(x)=- \frac{dU}{dx}=-kx$
		- opposes displacement from $x=0$, *restoring force*
## the work that *you* do
- if *you* apply an equal and opposite force to a conservative force, you are pushing against the conservative force and you increase the potential energy
	- eg: raising a mass against gravity
		- you do positive work on the mass
		- gravity does negative work on the mass
