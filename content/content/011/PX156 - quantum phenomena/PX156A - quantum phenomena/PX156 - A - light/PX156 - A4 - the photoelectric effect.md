- the emission of electrons from a metal surface due to incident electromagnetic radiation

- lenard's experimental observations:
	- not all electrons emerge with the same kinetic energy
	- the maximum kinetic energy is independent of the intensity of light, but dependent on the frequency
	- no electrons are emitted if the frequency of light is lower than a critical value, the *threshold frequency*

$$\boxed{KE_{e^{-}} = hf - \phi}$$
	where, $\phi=$ *work function energy*: energy required to remove the electron

- for a photon with $\lambda=700\,nm$, $f=430\,THz:$ $$E = hf = 3\times10^{-19}\,J$$
- considering photon as a particle: $$\begin{align*}
		E_{tot} &= KE + m_{0}c^{2} \\
		&= (\gamma-1)m_{0}c^{2}+m_{0}c^{2} \\
		&= \gamma m_{0}c^{2} \\
		&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- \frac{u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}m_{0}c^{2}
	\end{align*}$$
	where, $\gamma =$ [[PX155 - H1 - lorentz transformation|lorentz factor]]
- for $u\to c: E\to \infty$ if $m_{0}\neq 0$
$$E_{tot}^{2}= (m_{0}c^{2})^{2} + (pc)^{2}$$
- for $m_{0}=0: E=pc=hf:$ $$\boxed{ p = \frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}}$$
