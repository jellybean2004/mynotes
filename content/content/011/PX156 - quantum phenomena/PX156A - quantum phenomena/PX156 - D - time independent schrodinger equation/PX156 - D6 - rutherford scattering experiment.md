- $\alpha$ particle:  $^{4}He:$ very stable $:BE=28.3\,MeV \sim ^{12}C,\, ^{16}O$
- $^{3}He:$ less stable $:BE=8\,MeV$

- $1910-11:$ $\alpha$ particles were known to be heavy, stable, positively-charged, with speed $\sim 10^{7}\,ms^{-1}$; travel a few centimetres in air, $\sim0.1\,mm$ in solids

- a beam of $\alpha$ particles bombarded on a thin gold-foil target
- surrounded by zinc sulphide scintillation screens to detect the scattered particles, which produces a flash of light when it hits the scintillation screen
- most particles passed through, only some were reflected
- showed that atoms are mostly empty spaces with the positive nuclei occupying a tiny volume
- size of the nuclei $\sim10^{-14}\,m$, total volume $\sim 10^{-12}$ of the atom, contains $99.95\%$ of the mass
