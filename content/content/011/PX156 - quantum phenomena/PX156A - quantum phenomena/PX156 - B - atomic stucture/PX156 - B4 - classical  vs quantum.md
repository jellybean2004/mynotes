## classical approach
- consider a particle of mass, $m$, in 1D, subjected to a force, $F(x,t)$
- $v = \frac{dv}{dt}$, ${} p=mv$, $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$
- from [[PX155 - A2 - newton's second law|newton's second law]]: $$F=ma$$
- potential energy function, $V(x)$
$$m \frac{d^{2}v}{dt^{2}}= - \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}$$
	+ initial conditions

## quantum approach
### bohr's correspondence principle
- "Bohr reasoned thatÂ any new theory had to do more than describe atomic phenomena correctly; it must be applicable to conventional phenomena, too, in such a way that it would reproduce the old physics" [SRC](https://www.britannica.com/science/correspondence-principle#:~:text=Bohr%20reasoned%20that%20any%20new,this%20is%20the%20correspondence%20principle.&text=The%20correspondence%20principle%20applies%20to%20other%20theories%20besides%20quantum%20theory.)
## [[PX154 - F2 - the wave equation|the wave equation]]
- considering a transverse wave travelling in the $x$-direction with a speed, $v$ (displacement is  in $y$), the wave equation is: $$\frac{\partial^{2} {y}}{\partial {x}^{2}} = \frac{1}{v^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2} {y}}{\partial {t}^{2}}$$
- solutions${} :y= Y(x\pm vt)$
- general solutions: 
	$y= A \exp(ikx-i\omega t)$
	$y = A[\cos(kx-\omega t)+ i\sin(kx-\omega t)]$
