- an exchange of quantum numbers between two particles, mostly, but not always, carried by a force particle
- each force only interacts with particles carrying the specific charge that the force can 'see'
## gravity
- responsible for large scale structure of the universe
- acts between masses
## electromagnetic
- responsible for all the everyday interactions that can be seen around
- interacts with anything with an electric charge
- the force carrier is the *photon*
- photons only see '+' and '-' electric charges
## weak force
- destroys stuff - responsible for fission, radioactive decay
- interacts with 'weak isospin', there are two types of this
- the force carriers are: $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$ bosons
- the fact that there are three force carriers arises from the splitting of weak and electromagnetic forces
## strong force
- builds stuff - binds particles/nucleons/nuclei together
- interacts with the 'colour' charge: red, green, and blue
