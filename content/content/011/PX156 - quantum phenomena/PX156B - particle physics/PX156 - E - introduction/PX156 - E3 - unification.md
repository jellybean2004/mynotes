- forces:
	- electric
	- magnetic
	- weak
	- strong
	- gravity

- electric and magnetic: **electromagnetic**, maxwell (1800's), einstein (1900's)
- electromagnetic and weak: **electroweak** (1970's)
- electroweak and strong haven't been unified yet, very close

- these forces are described by *gauge theory*
- gravity is described by *general relativity*, which is very different
- *quantum gravity* hopes to unify gravity with the rest: *super force* or *grand unified theory* (GUT)
