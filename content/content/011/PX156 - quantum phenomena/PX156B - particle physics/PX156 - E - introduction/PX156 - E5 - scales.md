- **why are high energy colliders used to study the physics of small particles?**
- *classical optics*: in order to image something on a given length scale, a probe of the same scale needs to be used
- ie: to resolve very small scales, very small wavelengths are needed
- the *de broglie wavelength* of other particles is used to 'image' due to [[PX156 - B3 - de broglie hypothesis|wave-particle duality]]: $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
- to observe very small details, high momentum/energy particle are needed
- high energy colliders create a probe of the right composition and momentum in order to visualize a target of a specific size


- eg: what electron accelerating voltage is needed to observe a particle of diameter $10^{-15}\,m$?
	$$\begin{align*}
		\lambda &= 10^{-15}\,m \\
		\implies p &= 6.63\times10^{-19} \\
		&\approx  1\,{GeV}/{c}\\\\
		eV &= \frac{p^{2}}{2m} \\
		\therefore V &\approx 1.5\,TeV
	\end{align*}$$

- particle physics is just optics at a small length scales

## the rayleigh criterion
$$\Delta = 1.22 \lambda$$

- an object is just resolvable if the central maxima from one slit aligns with the first minima from the other

- microscopy scales:
	- optical: $\lambda=500nm$ - microorganisms
	- AFM: $\lambda =1\,nm$ - molecules
	- STM: $\lambda=.1\,nm$ - atoms
	- STM: $\lambda=.01\,nm$ - inside atoms

- an object $\sim1.5\,m$
- molecules $\sim10^{-7}\,m$
- atoms $\sim 10^-15\,m$
- quark $\sim \, ?$
