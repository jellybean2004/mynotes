## properties
![[Pasted image 20240429140925.png]]
- make up all matter
- feel all [[PX156 - E2 - forces|forces]]
- carry 3 charges: $Q, T_{W},$ colour
- 3 types of colour charges:
	- red ($r$)
	- green ($g$)
	- blue ($b$)

- come with anti-particles: $\bar u, \bar d, \bar c, \bar s, \bar t, \bar b$
	- charges have opposite signs:
	- colours: $\bar r, \bar g, \bar b$
- eg: 
	- $u: Q= + \frac{2}{3}e, T_W = + 1.2 , r$
	- $\bar u: Q= - \frac{2}{3}e, T_W = - 1.2 , \bar r$

- $Q, T_{W}$ and colour are all conserved quantities
## flavour number
- similar to [[PX156 - F3 - leptons#lepton number|lepton number]]

| flavour | flavour number |
| ------- | -------------- |
| u       | $+ 1/2$        |
| d       | $- 1/2$        |
| c       | $+ 1$          |
| s       | $- 1$          |
| t       | $+ 1$          |
| b       | $- 1$          |
- can use $\pm 1$ for $u,d$
- the numbers are assigned to quarks of the same flavour
- for other flavours, the number will be zero

## conservation of flavour
- flavour is conserved for electromagnetic and strong interactions
- it is violated by the weak interaction
- flavour non-conservation does not automatically imply that an interaction cannot happen
