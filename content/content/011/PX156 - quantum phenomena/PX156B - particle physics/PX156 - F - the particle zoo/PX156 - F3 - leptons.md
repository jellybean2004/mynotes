## properties
![[Pasted image 20240427185037.png]]
- leptons don't carry colour charge
- therefore don't feel the strong force

- since the leptons have either $T_{W}=\frac{1}{2}$ (neutrinos), or $T_{W}=- \frac{1}{2}$ (charged leptons)
- the weak force (W boson) only sees two variations of leptons

- masses of neutrinos are unknown but $< 30\,meV/c^{2}$
## lepton number
- '*lepton number*' is defined for each lepton
- the associated lepton has a lepton number of $+1$, and its anti-particle has a lepton number of $-1$

- $L_{e}:$ electron lepton number
	- $+1: e^{-}, \nu_{e}$ 
	- $-1: e^{+}, \bar{\nu}_{e}$
	- $0:$ otherwise
- $L_{\mu}:$ muon lepton number
	- $+1: \mu^{-}, \nu_{\mu}$ 
	- $-1: \mu^{+}, \bar{\nu}_{\mu}$
	- $0:$ otherwise
- $L_{\tau}:$ tau lepton number
	- $+1: \tau^{-}, \nu_{\tau}$ 
	- $-1: \tau^{+}, \bar{\nu}_{\tau}$
	- $0:$ otherwise

- global lepton number: $L = L_{e}+L_{\mu}+L_{\tau}$
	- it is always always conserved

- eg: $$\tau^{-}\to \mu^{-}+ \bar\nu_{\mu}+\nu_\tau$$
	- $Q: -1 \to -1 + 0 + 0:$ conserved
	- $L_{e}: 0 \to 0 + 0 + 0:$ conserved
	- $L_{\mu}: 0 \to +1 + (-1) + 0:$ conserved
	- $L\tau : +1 \to 0 + 0 + 1:$ conserved
	- $L: +1 \to +1 + (-1) + 1:$ conserved
	- $T_{w} : -\frac{1}{2} \to -\frac{1}{2} + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)+ \frac{1}{2}:$ conserved

- good theoretical reasons why $Q, T_{w}, L$ are conserved
- nothing to motivate the conservation of $L_{e}, L_{\mu}, L_{\tau}$ separately
 
- experiments test for lepton number conservation by looking for decay
	- $\mu^{-} \to e^{-}+\gamma:$ probability$<10^{-10}$
