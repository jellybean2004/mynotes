- for an interaction to happen, quantum numbers need to be conserved through the interaction
- steve's list:
	- Q
	- B
	- L
	- $L_{e}, L_{\tau}, L_{\mu}$
	- flavour (if violates: weak interaction)
	- for decays: 1 particle $\to n$ particles
		- total mass has to be conserved in the rest frame of the initial particle

- eg: can this interaction happen? $$p \to \pi^{0}(u\bar u) + e^{+} + \bar\nu_{e}$$
	- $Q: +1 \to +0 +1 +0:$ conserved
	- $B: +1 \to +0 +0 +0:$ not conserved
	- therefore, it cannot happen

- eg: $$\rho^{0}(u\bar u) \to \pi^{+} (u\bar d) + \pi^{-}(\bar u d)$$
	- ${} Q: 0 \to 1-1: {}$ conserved
	- $B: 0\to0+0:$ conserved
	- $L: 0\to0+0:$ conserved
	- flavour:
		- $u: +\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\to \left[+\frac{1}{2}+0\right] + \left[-\frac{1}{2}+0\right]:$ conserved
		- $d:$ conserved as well
		- $c,s,t,b: 0$ 
	- mass: 
		- ${} M(\rho)=770\,Mev/c^2 {}$
		- $M(\pi)=139\,Mev/c^2$
		- $M(\rho)>2\times M(\pi)$
	- interaction can happen
