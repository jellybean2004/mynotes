- these make countable transformations to a system which returns the system to the start after repeated application a finite number of times
- **not controlled by noether's theorem**

- conservation of a discrete symmetry that the probabilities of an interaction happening in the original and transformed system are the same

	- $L = r\times p$
	- by $\hat P: r\to-r\; ;\; p\to-p \implies L\to L$
## combined symmetries
- $\hat C \hat P:$ $$\begin{align*}
	x\to-x \\
	y\to-y \\
	z\to-z \\
	p\to\bar p
\end{align*}$$
	- conserved by the strong, and the EM forces
	- not by the weak force

- $\hat C\hat P\hat T:$ $$\begin{align*}
	x\to-x \\
	y\to-y \\
	z\to-z \\
	p\to\bar p \\
	t\to-t
\end{align*}$$
$$\begin{gather}
Prob_{1}= P[A(\vec p_{A}) + B(\vec p_{B}) \to C(\vec p_{C}) + D(\vec p_{D})] \\ \Bigg\downarrow \hat C\hat P\hat T \\ 
Prob_{2} = P[\bar C(-\vec p_{C}) + \bar D(-\vec p_{D}) \to \bar A(-\vec p_{A}) + \bar B(-\vec p_{B})] \\\\
Prob_{1}= Prob_{2}
\end{gather}$$
- **conserved by the strong, the EM, and the weak forces**
- necessary for *quantum field theory*

 - parity non-conservation by the weak interaction came as a shock
 - $\hat C\hat P$ violation leads to a solution for why the universe of matter-dominated universe
 - $\hat C\hat P$ violation $\implies$ matter-antimatter imbalance
