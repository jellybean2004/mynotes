- particle physics is the physics of symmetries
- a *symmetry* is an operation on a system which leaves the system, the physics and/or the maths describing the system unchanged
- the maths governing symmetries like this is *group theory*

- types of symmetries
	- **continuous**: an infinite number of operation maps the system on to itself, ie: smoothly differentiable
		- eg: rotating a circle by $d\theta$
		- known as a *lie group*
	- **discrete**: a finite number of operation maps the system on to itself
		- eg: rotating a square by $90\degree$
	- **internal symmetries**: changing the maths describing the system doesn't change the predictions

## noether's theorem
- any system with a continuous, differentiable symmetry embodies an associated conservation law
