## scattering
$$e^{-}(1) + e^{+}(2) \to e^{-}(3)+ e^{+}(4)$$
- **process 1**: an $e^{-}$ emits a photon that is absorbed by an $e^{+}$

- **process 2**: an $e^{+}$ emits a photon that is absorbed by a $e^{-}$

- $P(process 1) = P(process 2)$
- the scattering can be drawn vertically to average the time evolving
