- a photon can be emitted/absorbed by a lepton or a quark

- everything can emit/absorb a $Z^{0}$ boson

- gluons only interact with quarks or themselves

- $W^{\pm}$ are quite complicated
	- [[PX156 - F3 - leptons|leptons]]:
		- transitions between charged and neutral leptons of the same family
		- eg: $e^{-}\to W^{-}\nu_{e}$ ; $W^{-}\to \nu_{e}e^{-}$
		- $W$ bosons preserve the family/generation of leptons
	- [[PX156 - F4 - quarks|quarks]]:
		- transitions between top to bottom rows
		- cross-generational couplings are allowed

- there are no cross-generational couplings at the same level
	- eg: $d\to s$ ; $t\to c$ are not allowed
	- ie: no 'flavour changing neutral currents'

- conservation rules apply at **each** vertex

- **crossing symmetries**
	- if there is a workable interaction, it can be changed into another interaction by moving a line from the initial state to the final state, and turning the line into an antiparticle, as long as energy is conserved
	- eg: $u \to W^{+}d$
		- possible interactions

		- not possible: violates conservation of energy
