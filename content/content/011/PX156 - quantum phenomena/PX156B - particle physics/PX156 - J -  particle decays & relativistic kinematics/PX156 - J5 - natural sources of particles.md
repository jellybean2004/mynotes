## natural radioactivity
### $\beta$-decay in the earth:
- makes up about $2/3$ of the heat output at the surface $(\sim40\,TW)$
- useful for tuning geological models of the earth's composition
- flux $=10^{6}\,\nu\,s^{-1}cm^{-2}$
- energies $<3\,MeV$
### cosmic ray showers

- very high energy hadrons and $\alpha$-particles 
- generated by violent astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGN), supernovae, colliding galaxies, etc
- do not know where they come from
- directions are scrambled by magnetic fields in the galaxy and extragalactic fields
- flux: $1\,m^{-2}s^{-1}\to 1\,km^{-2}s^{-1}$
- energies: $1\,MeV\to 10^{10}\,eV$
### solar particles
- in addition to photons

- a lot of particles are emitted by the sun
#### solar wind 
- plasma of charged particles emitted from the solar corona and streaming into space
- responsible for space weather
- flux $=10^{9}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}$
- energies $\simeq MeV$
#### solar neutrinos
- $\nu_{e}$ generated in the fusion process which power the sun
- flux $=10^10\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}$
- energies $=1-10\,MeV$
