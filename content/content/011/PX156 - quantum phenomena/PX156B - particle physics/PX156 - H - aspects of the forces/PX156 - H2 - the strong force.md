- boson: gluons ($g$)
	- rest mass: $0$
	- *technically* infinite range
	- but carry colour charge themselves
- conserves all quantum numbers
- a gluon carries a colour, and an anti-colour
	- eg: $g: r\bar b$
- needed to conserve colour at vertices
	- eg: $q_{r} \to q_{b} + g_{r\bar b}$

- there are 8 gluons in the strong force
- there is one gluon that cannot be seen: a colourless gluon
	- eg: $g\sim r\bar r$ cannot exist
- so, some decays cannot happen
	- eg: $\pi^{0}(u\bar u) \to g \,?:$ no! as $\pi^{0}$ is colourless

- *gluons can interact with other gluons*
- this is the defining difference with the EM interaction

- large distances: constant, very strong, restoring force with the form: $$F_{strong} = \frac{\alpha_{s}}{r^{2}}-k$$
- at a small distance, $k\approx 1\,GeV/fm$
- $\alpha_{S}\approx 140 \times \alpha_{EM}$
- as $r\to\infty: F_{strong}\sim-k$

- small distances (within nucleons): acts like the EM force, but is very weak
- small distances between quarks: coulomb force dominates
- eg:
	- within a nucleus, $\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ force
	- long distances: $F\sim -k \implies$ constant attractive force
- this drives the behaviour of the strong force at large distances

- acts like a rubber band
- two distinct types of behaviours at different distance scales
- small distances: ends can move independently and freely
- large distances: energy stored as it 'stretches'
- eventually energy stored is enough to break the bond and the band snaps
## hadronization & the principle of confinement
- quarks can never be separated from nuclei to get a lone quark
- as quarks separate, more energy needs to be donated and this energy is stored in the colour field between the quarks
- at some point, the energy density in the field is greater than the mass of two quarks
- at this point, the colour tube snaps and creates two new quarks
- this process is called *hadronization*
- the fact that quarks are locked in hadrons is called the '*principle of confinement*'

- in experiments, this gives rise to jets of hadrons that are clustered around the direction of one of the initial quarks
