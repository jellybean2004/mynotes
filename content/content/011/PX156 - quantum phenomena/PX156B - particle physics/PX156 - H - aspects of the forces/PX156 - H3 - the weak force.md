### charged current (CC)
- bosons: $W^{\pm}$
	- rest mass: $0$
	- electrically charged
	- weak isospin
	- $m_{W}\approx 80\,GeV/c^{2}$ (very heavy)
- *the only force that can change flavour*
- couples states of different weak isospin
- [[PX156 - F3 - leptons|leptons]]: 
	- have $T_{W}=\pm 1/2$
	- transform particles from top row to bottom, and vice versa, in the same generation
- [[PX156 - F4 - quarks|quarks]]
	- have $T_{W}=\pm 1/2$
	- transform particles from top row to bottom, and vice versa, in same and different generations

### neutral current (NC)
- boson: $Z^{0}$
	- neutrally charged
	- $m_{Z}\approx 90\,GeV/c^{2}$
- *it cannot change flavour*
- decay into any particle-antiparticle pair of the same flavour
	- eg: ${} Z^{0} \to l^{+}l^{-}$ or $q\bar q$ or $\bar\nu\nu$

- range: $$F= \frac{\alpha_{W,Z}}{r^{2}} \exp\left(-\frac{r}{R}\right)$$
	- where, $R= \frac{\hbar}{m_{W,Z}\,c}$ 
- large boson mass $\implies$ exponential term supresses the force at moderate distances
- **note:** $\alpha_{W,Z} \approx 5\,\alpha_{EM}$
	- the 'weakness' of the weak force comes from the mass of the bosons
