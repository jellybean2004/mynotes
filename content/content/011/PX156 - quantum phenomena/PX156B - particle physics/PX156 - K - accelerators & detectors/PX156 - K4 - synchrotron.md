- a 'classical accelerator'
- essentially an inverse [[PX156 - K3 - cyclotron|cyclotron]]
- particles are accelerated at a constant radius, kept constant by a changing magnetic field
- a circle lined with accelerating RF cavities and magnets to guide the beam
- the strength of the $B$-field changes as the beam particle changes speed
- great for high energy beams

- charged particles under acceleration radiate power: *synchrotron radiation*
- particles lose energy going around a ring
- energy loss: $$\Delta E \sim \left(\frac{E}{m}\right)^{4} \frac{1}{r}$$
- $\frac{1}{r}:$ higher energy loss for small radius
- $(\frac{E}{m}):$ very inefficient to accelerate electrons in a synchrotron

## types
- large electron positron collider (LEP)
- HERA - electron-proton collider
- tevatron, fermilab - proton-antiproton collider
- large hadron collider (LHC), CERN - pp collider
- DIAMOND synchrotron light source (SRS)
