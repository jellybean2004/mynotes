- **tracker**: 
	- a $1\,GeV$ proton in a $1\,T$ field has a bending radius of $1-50\,m$
	- tracker shall have a radius of at least $1\,m$

- **ECAL**: 
	- $x_{0}$ lead$=0.5\,cm$: ECAL thickness of $\leq 10\,x_{0}=5\,cm$ 
		- but lead is opaque
	- $x_{0}\, PbW)_{4}= 1.3\,cm$: ECAL thickness $=13\,cm$
	- + detectors: $20\,cm$
- **HCAL**: 
	- $10\lambda_I$ iron $=2\,m$
	- + detectors: ${} 3\,m$
- **muon**: 
	- $1-2\,m$
- **detector: 6-7m in radius already**

- big heavy detectors are built because the physics constraints of the material used require it
- the onion-design can also be used to do particle identification
