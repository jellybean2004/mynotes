- to accelerate heavy things (eg: protons, ions) in not much space
- essentially a rolled up [[PX156 - K2 - linear accelerator|linear accelerator]]

![[Pasted image 20240523181608.png]]
- hollow conducting structures known as '*Dees*' connected to an AC source
- the electric field in the gap changes direction as the AC power supply
- particle accelerates across the gap under the application of an electric field
- moves in a half circle in the Dee under the application of a magnetic field
- moves faster in subsequent half-orbit

- **key: time taken to travel each half orbit is the same: 'equal time assumption**
- time in Dee: $$\begin{align*}
		t &= \frac{d}{v} \\
		&= \frac{\pi}{v}r \\
		&= \frac{\pi}{v} \cdot \frac{mv}{qB} \\
		\therefore t&= \frac{\pi m}{qB}
	\end{align*}$$
## advantages
- cheap
- small footprint
- can accelerate relatively heavy particles
## drawbacks
- relies on the 'equal time assumption'
	- fine at low-medium energies $\sim 100\,MeV$
	- relativistic speeds are difficult to accelerate to
