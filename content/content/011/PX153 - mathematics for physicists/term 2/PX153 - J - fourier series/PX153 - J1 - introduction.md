$$f(x) = \frac{a_{0}}{2} + \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}\cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) +b_{n}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \right)$$ for $-L \leq x \leq L$
- it is not obvious that an arbitrary function, $f(x)$, can be expressed as such in an interval, $-L \leq x \leq L$ 

- **questions**:
	- what functions, $f(x)$, can be expressed as such?
	- how fast/well does the sum converge?
	- given a function, $f(x)$, how can $a_{0}$, $a_{n}$, and $b_{n}$ be calculated? ^04a8fb
	- why is this needed? ^142629
