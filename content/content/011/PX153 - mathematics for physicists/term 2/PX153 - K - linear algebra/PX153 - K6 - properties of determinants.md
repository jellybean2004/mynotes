- $(i):$ $$\det A = \det A^{T}$$
- $(ii):$ $$\det AB = \det A \, \det B$$
- $(iii):$ $$\det I_{n} =1$$
- $(iv):$ $$\det \lambda A = \lambda^{n}\det A$$
- $(v):$ if only one row is multiplied by $\lambda$, $\det A$ is multiplied by $\lambda$
- ${} (vi): {}$ if $B$ is obtained by interchanging two rows/columns of a matrix, $A$, then, $\det B = -\det A$
- $(vii):$ if $row(i)$ is replaced by ${} [row(i) +\lambda\times row(j)] {}$, where $i \neq j$, the determinant is unchanged
- $(viii):$ if two rows are identical, the determinant is zero

- eg: $$A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & i & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & -i \\ 1 & i & 0\end{bmatrix}$$
	- expanding the $1^{st}$ row: $\det A = -1$
	- expanding the $3^{rd}$ row: $\det A = -1$

- notes for examples about reducing $4\times 4$ matrix to easily calculate the determinant
