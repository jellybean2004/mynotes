- non-linear ODEs are usually very difficult or impossible to solve, so, we try to make assumptions to simplify them
- here, we give the example of a pendulum
- ![[Pasted image 20231031162134.png]]
- the length of arc $ds$ travelled in $dt$ is related to the change in the angle $d\theta$: $ds = ld\theta$
- so the acceleration is $\frac{d^{2}s}{dt^{2}} = l \frac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}}$
- this must be equal to the component of the gravity tangential to the trajectory $-mg\sin\theta$
- giving: $ml \frac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}} = -mg\sin\theta$
		$$\frac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}} = - \frac{g}{l}\sin\theta$$
	- this is non-linear and very tough to solve
- to simplify the differential, we make a small angle approximation, such that $\sin\theta \approx \theta$: $$\frac{d^{2}\theta}{dt^{2}} \simeq - \frac{g}{l}\theta$$
