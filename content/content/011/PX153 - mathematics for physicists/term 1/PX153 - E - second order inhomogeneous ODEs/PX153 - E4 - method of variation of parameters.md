- a more general method for finding the particular integral
- consider a 2nd order inhomogeneous ODE: $$ay''+by'+cy = f(x)$$
- we first find the complementary function: $$y_{c} = C u_{1}(x) + D u_{2}(x)$$
- we assume that we can write the particular integral in the following form: $$y_{p}(x) = P(x)u_{1}(x) + Q(x)u_{2}(x)$$ for some arbitrary functions $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$
- we want to find $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ in terms of $u_{1}(x), u_{2}(x), f(x)$
- first, calculate the derivative: $$y'_{p}(x) = P'(x)u_{1}(x) + P(x)u'_{1}(x) + Q'(x)u_{2}(x) + Q(x)u'_{2}(x)$$
- we put the following constraint: $P' u_{1}+ Q' u_{2}=0$
- the second derivative is then: $$y''_{p}(x) = P'(x)u'_{1}(x) + P(x)u''_{1}(x) + Q'(x)u'_{2}(x) + Q(x)u''_{2}(x)$$
- in the ODE, this gives: $$a(P'u'_{1} + Q'u'_{2})+ a( Pu''_{1} + Qu''_{2}) + b(Pu'_{1} + Qu'_{2}) + c(Pu_{1}+Qu_{2})=f(x)$$
$$a(P'u'_{1} + Q'u'_{2}) + P(au_{1}'' + bu_{1}' +cu_{1}) + Q(au_{2}'' + bu_{2}' +cu_{2})= f(x)$$
$$a(P'u'_{1} + Q'u'_{2}) = f(x)...[2]$$
$$P'u_{1}+Q'u_{2}= 0 ...[1]$$
- from $[1]$: $$Q' = - \frac{u_{1}}{u_{2}}P'$$
- subbing in $[2]$: $$P'\left( \frac{u'_{1}u_{2}-u_{1}u'_{2}}{u_{2}}\right) = \frac{f(x)}{a}$$
$$\implies P' = - \frac{1}{a}\frac{u_{2}f(x)}{u_{1}u'_{2}-u'_{1}u_{2}}$$
$$\implies Q' = \frac{1}{a} \frac{u_{1}f(x)}{u_{1}u'_{2}-u'_{1}u_{2}}$$

## problem class notes
- $y = u y_{1} + vy_{2}$ is a solution
- we can use two equations:
	$$u' y_{1} + v' y_{2}=0$$
	$$u' y_{1}' + v' y_{2}' = f(x)$$
- you should end up with 4 equations
