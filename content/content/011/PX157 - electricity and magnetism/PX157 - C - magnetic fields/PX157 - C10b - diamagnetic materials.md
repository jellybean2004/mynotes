- $\mu_{r}<1:$ magnetic field inside the material is reduced
- no permanent atomic $\vec\mu$, only those induced by $\vec B_{0}$. induced $\vec\mu$ are anti-parallel to $\vec B_{0}$ (lenz law)
- typically, $\mu_{r}\approx 0.99990-0.99999$
- have closed shell electronic structures, therefore, no net magnetic moment
- eg: free electron, noble gas, $H_{2}$, $N_{2}$, $NaCl$, $C$, $Si$, $Ge$
