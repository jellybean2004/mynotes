$$\epsilon = - \frac{d}{dt}(N\phi_{B}) = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$$
- in an electrical circuit, $\epsilon=-L \frac{dI}{dt}$ is the source of emf

- using [[PX157 - B14a - circuits - kirchhoff's rules#kirchhoff's loop rule|kirchhoff's loop rule]] around the closed circuit: $$\begin{align*}
		\epsilon - L \frac{dI}{dt} &= RI \\
		\epsilon &= L \frac{dI}{dt} + RI
	\end{align*}$$
