- the effect of an induced emf is such that it opposes the changing flux which produced it
- can be derived from [[PX157 - D1a - faraday's law|faraday's law]], from the sign convention that determined the direction of the induced emf

- eg: for [[PX157 - D1b - a moving crossbar|a moving crossbar]]
	![[Pasted image 20240226181211.png]]
	- the motion of the crossbar increases $\phi_{B}$
	- the induced emf is clockwise
	- induced current is clockwise
	- [[PX157 - C4a - ampere's law|ampere's law]] gives that the induced magnetic field is opposite to the original magnetic field
	- $|\vec B_{ind.}| < |\vec B _{ext.}|$ due to finite resistance
