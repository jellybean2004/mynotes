- faraday's law of *induction* statues that the induced emf in a closed loop equals minus the rate of change of magnetic flux though the loop: $$\epsilon = - \frac{d\phi_{B}}{dt}$$
	where, [[PX157 - C1b - magnetic flux|magnetic flux]], $\phi_{B} = \iint_{S}\vec B\cdot d\vec S$ 

- the right-hand rule defines the direction of the current driven by the emf

- for multiple coils of wire with $N$ turns, each coil has the same emf: $$\epsilon = -N \frac{d\phi_{B}}{dt}$$
