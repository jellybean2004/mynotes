- static situation: in a conductor, $\vec E = 0$
- if $\vec E \neq 0$, free charges will move, which will inevitably cause them to collide with atoms. this will cause a resistive material to heat up
- this implies that temperature is a function of time, hence it is not static
- any excess charges on a conductor must be on the surface
	- if the gaussian surface is inside he conductor: $$\newcommand{\oiint}{\subset\!\supset \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\iint}
	\oiint \vec E\,d\vec S = 0 \implies Q_{encl.}=0$$
	- if the gaussian surface is on the edge of the conductor: $$\oiint \vec E\,d\vec S \neq 0 \implies \frac{Q_{encl.}}{\epsilon_{0}}$$
