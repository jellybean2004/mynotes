## energy and power in circuits
- energy of one charge feeling external potential, $V:$ $$U=q\,V$$
- energy of all charges in a volume, $Vol.:$ $$\Delta U = q\,n\,v_{d}\,\Delta t\, A\,V = \Delta Q\,V = I\, \Delta t\, V$$
- power: $$P = \frac{dU}{dt}\simeq \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta t}=VI$$
- for a resistor, $P=VI=RI^{2} =\frac{V^{2}}{R}>0$
	- takes energy out of a circuit
	- power delivered by the battery is dissipated in the circuit, *ohmic heating*: $$P= RI^{2}$$
- power per unit volume: $$\frac{P}{Vol.} = \frac{\rho L}{A} \frac{J^{2}A^{2}}{Vol.} = \rho \,J^{2}$$
## electromotive force
![[Pasted image 20240207102125.png]]
- $\vec E$ inside the battery acts opposite to $\vec E$ in the circuit
- requirements to maintain a steady current:
	- closed circuit
	- source of energy to move charges against the electric field in the battery, which is provided by a force such that: $$\vec F  = -q\,\vec E$$
- *electromotive force* (emf) is the work done by the force per unit charge
- units: $volts(V)$
- when there is no current flowing through the battery, $V=\epsilon$
- with a current, $V= \epsilon-r\,I$, where $r=$ internal resistance
## battery vs capacitor

| battery | capacitor |
| ---- | ---- |
| delivers a constant $\epsilon$ | delivers a time-varying $V(t)$ |
| $V(Q)= \epsilon$ | $V= Q/C$ |
| $U=Q\epsilon$ | $U = \frac{Q^2}{2C}$ |
