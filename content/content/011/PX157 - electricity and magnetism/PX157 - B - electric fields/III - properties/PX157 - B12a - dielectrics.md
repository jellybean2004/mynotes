## introduction
- in a dielectric (insulator), there are only bound charges if no excess charges have been applied

- subjecting a dipole to an electric field, the positive and negative charges in an atom are displaced slightly in opposite directions

- surface charges are induced by the external electric field, $\vec E$, which induces an electric field, $\vec E_{i}$, that opposes $\vec E$
## dielectric breakdown
- if the external electric field, $\vec E$, is strong enough, it can ionize the atoms $\implies$ free charges $\implies$ no more dielectric
- the maximum electric field that a dielectric can withstand is termed the dielectric strength, $E_{m}$
	- dry air: $E_{m}= 3\times10^{6}\,Vm^{-1}$
	- pyrex glass: $E_{m}= 10^{7}\,Vm^{-1}$
- polarization density $[Cm^{-2}]$: $$\vec P (\vec r) = \frac{1}{Vol.} \sum\limits_{i}\vec P_{i}$$
- electric displacement vector $[Cm^{-2}]$: $$\vec D = \epsilon_{0}\vec E + \vec P$$
- $\vec P$ and $\vec E$ are along the same direction
