- light is an EM wave, it can propagate through vacuum
- maxwell developed equations to describe electronic and magnetic fields. he realized these equations could be solved in the absence if any charges or magnets
- in a vacuum, two equations can be obtained: $$\frac{\partial^{2}E }{\partial x^{2}} = \epsilon_{0}\mu_{0} \frac{\partial^{2} E}{\partial t^{2}}$$ $$\frac{\partial^{2}B }{\partial x^{2}} = \epsilon_{0}\mu_{0} \frac{\partial^{2} B}{\partial t^{2}}$$
		where, $\epsilon_{0}=$ permittivity of free space, and $\mu_{0}=$ permeability of free space
	- wave equations!
	- we have, the wave speed: $$v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}} = c$$
	- ***comments***: 
		- the wave is a combination oscillating electric and magnetic fields
		- both travel together
		- they are transverse
- E and B fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation 
- the E-field is largely responsible for the interactions between light and matter
- B- field only has a small magnitude

- the E and B fields are vector quantities
- for a wave propagation along $x$, we might have: $$\vec E(x,t) = \vec j E_{0}\cos(kx-\omega t)$$$$\vec B(x,t) = \vec k B_{0}\cos(kx-\omega t)$$
