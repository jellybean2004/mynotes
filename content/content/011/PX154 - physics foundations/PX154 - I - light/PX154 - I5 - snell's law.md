- snell's law: $$n_{1}\sin\theta_{i} = n_{2}\sin\theta_{t}$$
- for the reflected ray, $$\theta_{i}=\theta_{r}$$
- if $n_{i}<n_{t}$, then $\theta_{i}>\theta_{t}$
- if $n_{i}>n_{t}$, then $\theta_{i}<\theta_{2}$ (eg: a light ray in water hitting its surface)
	- a *total internal reflection* can be obtained 
### total internal reflection
- from $n_{i}\sin\theta_{i} = n_{t}\sin\theta_{t}$ , $$\sin\theta_{t} = \frac{n_{i}}{n_{t}}\sin\theta_{i}$$
- if $\theta_{t}= 90\degree : \sin\theta_{t} = 1$
	- $\sin\theta_{i} = \frac{n_{t}}{n_{i}} = \sin\theta_{c}$ , where $\theta_{c}=$ critical angle
	- if $\sin\theta_{i}> \frac{n_{t}}{n_{i}} :$ no transmission
### brewster's law
- polarization by reflection: if the angle between $r_{t}$ and $r_{r}$ is $90\degree$ ![[Pasted image 20231207111548.png]]
- from snell's law: $$\tan\theta_{i} = \frac{n_{t}}{n_{i}}$$
	- this is brewster's law
	- for polarization, this is known as the "*polarization angle*", $\theta_{p}$
		- for $air\to glass: \theta_{p}=56.3\degree$
	- *frenel equations* will be needed to study this in more detail
### dispersion
- refractive index can depend on the wavelength/frequency
- snell's law conveys that light of different wavelengths will have different transmission angles (eg: rainbows, prism)
