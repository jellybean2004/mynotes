- at *high temperature, very similar results* from ideal gas and vdW equations

- vdw predictions differ at low temperatures
	- at $304K$, curve shows a *point of inflexion*
	- at lower temperatures, curve shows a local maximum and minimum
		- this is not physical: gas pressure doesn't change in this manner
	- to interpret this, a horizontal line is drawn such that $Area_X=Area_Y$ 
		- compressing from high volumes, it begins to liquify at $A$
		- further compression increases liquification
		- all gas is liquified at $B$
		- pressure remains constant throughout
		- note that curve is much steeper at lower volumes as liquid is difficult to compress
