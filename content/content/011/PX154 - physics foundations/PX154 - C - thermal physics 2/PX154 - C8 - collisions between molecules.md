- the average time between collisions is defined as: $$t_{mean} = \frac{1}{4\pi \sqrt{2}} \frac{V}{r^{2}v_{rms}N}$$
		$r=$ radius of a spherical molecule
- $N_{2} \; at \; STP : t_{mean} = 1.2 \times 10^{-10}s$
- then mean distance travelled between collisions can be defined as "*the mean free path*", $\lambda$: $$\lambda = v_{rms}t_{mean}= \frac{V}{4\pi \sqrt{2} r^{2}N}$$
- or using *[[PX154 - C1 - ideal gas equation of state#^b45b14|ideal gas equation]]*: $$\lambda = \frac{k_{B}T}{4\pi \sqrt{2} r^{2}p}$$
	$N_{2} \; at \; STP: t_{mean}=1.2\times 10^{-10}s,\; \lambda = 5.8 \times 10^{-8}m (\approx 300r_{N_2})$
