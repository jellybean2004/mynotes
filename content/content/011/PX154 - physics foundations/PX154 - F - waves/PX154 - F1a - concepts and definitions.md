## types of waves 
### mechanical 
[YF ch 15, 16]
- sound wave
- waves through solid materials
- waves at sea
- piano string
### electromagnetic
- light, x-ray, gamma, IR, etc
- can travel through vacuum
- can travel through media
- gets complicated...
### matter waves 
- quantum mechanics, [[PX156 - B3 - de broglie hypothesis|wave-particle duality]]
- sometimes treat particles as having wave behaviour
## concepts and definitions
[YF 15.2, 15.3]
- initially, we will consider travelling waves
- for now, use one-dimensional propagation
- no translation of material with the wave
	- the material oscillates about a fixed position
- we need a wavefunction, that includes position and time dependence
