## the wave speed
![[Pasted image 20231115100641.png]]
- in time, $T$, a wave peak moves a distance, $\lambda$
- to find the wave speed: $$v = \frac{\lambda}{T} = f \lambda= \frac{\omega}{k}$$
	- where, $\omega= 2\pi f$, and $k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
- ***comment***:
	- $v$ is also known as *phase speed* or *phase velocity*
	- we have wave function $u(x,t)$, but $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \neq v$  
## motion of the wave's substance
[YF p500]
- ***transverse wave***: vibrations of the particles are *perpendicular* to the direction of travel of the wave. modelling this transverse motion as SHM
- ***longitudinal wave***: vibrations of the particles are *parallel* to the direction of the travel of the wave. the particles are still doing SHM about a fixed position
- our wave function, $u(x,t)=A\cos(kx-\omega t)$, tells us about the motion of the slinky itself. eg: for a transverse wave, this is only perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel. then: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = A \omega\sin(kx-\omega t)$$
	- this is **not** the speed of the wave
- for our wave:
