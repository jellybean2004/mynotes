## heat transfers
- consider a heat engine placed next to a cold engine
![[Pasted image 20231107140851.png]]
- initially, the objects are not in equilibrium and heat is transferred from hot $\to$ cold until they have the same temperature

- heat will not be transferred to return to the first state of hot and cold, so, the process is irreversible
## isothermal and adiabatic processes
- in the study of *[[PX154 - E4 - the carnot cycle|the carnot cycle]]*, an isothermal expansion was first considered
- if the reservoir is the same temperature as the engine ($T_H$), then there is no heat transfer, so, $Q_{H}=0$, and nothing happens! ($W=0$)
- set $T_{engine}<T_{H}$ in order to obtain $Q_{H}\neq 0$, but this is no longer reversible since heat is transferred from warmer reservoir to the cooler engine
- for an isothermal process an infinitesimally small difference in temperature is required so that the process could be reversed by an infinitesimally small change in conditions
- process has to be slow so that the engine can always be considered to be in equilibrium

- why does this matter?
	- if $T_{H}>T_{engine}$ then $Q_{H}+ve$, and some of $Q_H$ will go to work done, however, some of the heat, $Q_{H}$, will warm the engine
	- so, the work done, $W$, is reduced, which reduces efficiency
	- therefore, the reversible isotherm gives the maximum $W$ for a given $Q_{H}$

- adiabatic cooling (step $B\to C$ in *[[PX154 - E4 - the carnot cycle|the carnot cycle]]*)
	- still an expansion: engine doing work
	- cooling from $T_{H}\to T_{C}$
	- $T_{engine}$ is not known at any given time, but $T_{engine}>T_{C}:$ heat transfer to reservoir cannot be allowed to occur as this would be irreversible
	- if $Q_{C}=0$, then again $W$ is maximized
	- if $Q_{C}\neq0$, energy is lost to the reservoir reducing efficiency
## conclusion
- the most efficient cycle is reversible and consists of isotherms and adiabats
- however, all real processes are irreversible and proceed in a particular direction
	- *[[PX154 - D2 - the first law|the first law]]* doesn't tell this
	- *[[PX154 - E3 - the second law of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]]* does
