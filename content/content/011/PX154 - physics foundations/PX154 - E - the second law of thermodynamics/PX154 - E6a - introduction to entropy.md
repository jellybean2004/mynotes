[YF 20.7]
- eg: from *[[PX154 - E5 - reversible and irreversible processes#hear transfers|here]]*: $[hot | cold]\to[warm | warm]$ is irreversible
- the system becomes more random:
	- initially sorted into hot and cold regions
	- energy "mixes", meaning it is more disordered/random
	- the system has gained *entropy*
- eg: a reversible isotherm

		$T=constant$
		$\Delta U = 0$
	- from $A\to B: Q$ is added to do work 
	- at $V_{2}:$ molecules are able to move around in a larger volume, so, system is more disordered $\implies$ higher entropy
	- returning to $A$, gas is exactly the same as it was initially, so, for $A\to B \to A: \Delta S=0$
	- *$S$ is a function of state* $\implies \Delta S_{A\to B}$ doesn't depend on the path taken
