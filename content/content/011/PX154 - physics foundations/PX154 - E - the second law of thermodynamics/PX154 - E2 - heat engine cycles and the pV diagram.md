## cyclic processes
![[Pasted image 20231107143515.png]]
- from $A \to X$, engine does work:
	- pushes out the piston
	- heat input
- but from $B\to Y$, work is done on the system:
	- the piston needs to be pushed back in
	- heat output
- process is useful since $W=\int p.dV = p\Delta V$
	- $W$ is larger for $A\to X$ than $B \to Y$
	- useful work is done
- around one complete cycle:
		$\Delta U =0$
		$W \neq 0$
		$Q \neq 0$

## summary
- $Q_{C}\neq 0:$ always
		$W=Q_{H}+Q_{C}$
		 $Q_{H}+ve$
		$Q_{C}-ve$ 
- the efficiency is defined as the *ratio* of what we *want* to obtain to what we have to *put in*: $$\epsilon = \frac{W}{Q_{H}} = \frac{Q_{H}+Q_{C}}{Q_{H}}$$
- $\epsilon =1(100\%)$ only if $Q_{C}=0$, which never happens
- eg: otto cycle (petrol engine), diesel cycle [YF fig 20.5-20.7], stirling cycle, carnot cycle

- cycle is ran in reverse and work, $W$, is put *into the system*
- *efficiency*, known as the *coefficient of performance* $COP$ or $k$
- for fridge: $$k_{fr} = \frac{|Q_{C}|}{|W|} = \frac{|Q_{C}|}{|Q_{H}|-|Q_{C}|}$$ [YF eqn 20.9]

- heat pump: $$k_{hp} = \frac{|Q_{H}|}{|W|} = \frac{|Q_{H}|}{|Q_{H}|-|Q_{C}|}$$
- eg: *rankine cycle* (fridge) #revisit , stirling cycle in reverse, gifford-macmahon cycle (cryocooling),  pulse tube
