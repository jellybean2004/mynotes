- any point on the $pV$ diagram has a specific values of $p$ and $V$
- these then specify the temperature, and hence, the internal energy at that point

- take either path 1 ($isobar \to isochore$), or path 2 $(isochore \to isobar$) from $A\to B$:
	- $\Delta U$ is the same for both the paths
	- for $A \to X \to B: W = p_{1}(V_{2}-V_{1})+0$
	- for $A \to Y \to B: W = 0 + p_{2}(V_{2}-V_{1})$
	- but $p_{2}<p_{1}: W_{AYB}<W_{AXB}$, and $Q_{AYB}<Q_{AXB}$
$\therefore \Delta U$ is the same, but $Q$ and $W$ are different
