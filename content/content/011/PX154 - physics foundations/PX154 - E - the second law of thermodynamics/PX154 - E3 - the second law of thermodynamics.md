- this is a macroscopic law: obeyed by statistically significant number of particles
- it is an empirical law that has never been observed to fail

- "it is impossible for any system to undergo a process in which it absorbs heat from a reservoir at a single temperature and converts the heat completely into mechanical work, with the system ending in the same state in which it began"

- an engine takes in heat energy, $Q_{H}$, and does work, $W$. it is impossible for there to be zero waste heat, $Q_{C}$ expelled to the cold reservoir
- basically, $\epsilon \neq 100\%$
## clausius
- heat transfer from cold to hot never happens spontaneously
