### reversible
$$\Delta S = \int_{state\,1}^{state\,2} \frac{dQ}{T}$$
- however, $\Delta Q = 0$ for an adiabatic process, so: $$\Delta S = 0$$
- ***isentropic process*: entropy doesn't change**

### irreversible
- free expansion of an ideal gas [YF ex 20.8]

- process is adiabatic: $Q = 0$
- no work is done by the gas as there is no piston to push: $W=0$ 
- no change in internal energy: $\Delta U = 0 \implies T_{2}= T_{1}$
- does the entropy change?
	- process is irreversible, so, come up with a reversible isothermal process that achieves the same change in state
	- start and end points identical, but, the isothermal process requires: $$\begin{align*}
			Q = W &= nRT\ln{\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}} \\
			\Delta S &= nR\ln{\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}} \\
			&= nR \ln{2}
		\end{align*}$$
	- the entropy increases
