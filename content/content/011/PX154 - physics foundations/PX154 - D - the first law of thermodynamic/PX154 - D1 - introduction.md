## some concepts
- *[[PX154 - C1 - ideal gas equation of state|ideal gases]]* are considered
- systems:
	- consider a specific *system in a closed container*
		- no particles enter/leave $\implies n$ is constant
	- volume, $V$, must be changeable

	- a *piston* that moves without friction and with a perfect seal is used
		- *diathermal* wall: perfect heat transmission through wall via conduction
		- *adiabatic* wall: perfectly insulating, no heat transmission, often depicted as double wall
	- *states*:
		- the state of a system is given by the state variables at any given time 
			- $p$ - intensive variable
			- $V$ - extensive variable
			- $T$ - intensive variable
			- $m$ - extensive variable
			- $S$ (entropy) - extensive variable
		- *intensive* and *extensive* correspond to whether the variable changes with a change in the size of the system. so, if a system has twice the volume, it has twice the mass, but the temperature is the same.
