## a piston 
![[Pasted image 20231102133620.png]]
- if the gas in the system does work, it pushes out the piston $\implies$ the volume increases
- for the work done: $$dW = Fdx$$
- if plunger has are $A$, then, the force can be given by $F=pA$. so, $$dW=pAdx \implies dW=pdV$$
- hence, $$W = \int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}}p.dV$$ ^8e7f8e
