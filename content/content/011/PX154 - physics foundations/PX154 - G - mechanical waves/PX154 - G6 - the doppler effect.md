[[PX155 - H4 - relativistic doppler effect - seeing vs observing]]

- the apparent change in frequency as measure by an observer when the source and/or the observer are moving relative to each other
	- eg:
		- change in tone as a vehicle passes
		- redshift of galaxies
		- radar guns in speed traps
- we have to treat sound and EM wave differently because:
	- for sound, the speed is fixed relative to the atmosphere
		- we have to consider the motions of both the source and receiver relative to this
	- EM waves: just need the relative speed of the receiver relative to the source

- for sound, we find: $$f' = f \left( \frac{v+u_{0}}{v+u_{s}} \right)$$
		where, $f'=$ observed frequency, $f=$ source frequency, $u_{0}=$ velocity of observer, $u_{s}=$ velocity of source

- always be careful about signs:
	- $f'>f$: moving closer
	- $f'<f$: moving away

- compare with EM waves: $$f' = f\sqrt{\frac{c-v}{c+v}}$$
		where, $c=$ speed of light, $v=$ the relative speed of source and observer
