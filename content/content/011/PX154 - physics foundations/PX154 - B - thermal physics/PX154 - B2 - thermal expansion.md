## thermometer
- heating causes expansion
	- liquid rises up the tube as the temperature increases
	- but the glass expands too
	- most materials expand as they heat up but different materials expand by different amounts
		- we define the *expansion coefficient* 
![[Pasted image 20231010183153.png]]
- *why do materials expand?* 
	-  as the temperature increases, the mean atomic separation increases (atoms vibrating about the mean position)
## linear expansion coefficient
![[Pasted image 20231010183228.png]]
- [YF17.8]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231011100820.png]]
- new length: $L=L_{0}+\Delta L$ ^2b2871
	- $\Delta L$ can be defined in terms of the change in temperature
	- $\Delta L = \alpha L_{0}\Delta T$
		- where $\alpha=$ linear expansion coefficient
	- works for moderate temperature changes
	- then we define $$\alpha = \frac{1}{L_0}\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta T}$$ ^4680f7
		- its units are $K^{-1}$
	- eg: [YF table 17.1]

## volume expansion coefficient
- in the same manner as in [[PX154 - B1 - heat and temperature#linear expansion coefficient|linear expansion coefficient]], we can define the volume expansion coefficient: $$\beta = \frac{1}{V_0}\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta T}$$
	$$\Delta V = \beta V_{0}\Delta T$$
	- eg: [YF table 1.2] 
		![[Pasted image 20231011102215.png]]
		- can see $\beta=3\alpha$
	- [YF P576] for derivation: ![[Pasted image 20231011102350.png]]
	- ***comments***:
		- we are considering isotropic materials which have the same properties in different directions
		- we are assuming that the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constant
			- some materials have odd behaviour
				- eg: water near $0\degree C$ or invar
