## temperature 
- a physical property related to the kinetic energy of the atoms, molecules and/or electrons of the system under study
	- this energy is the "internal energy" of the system, given the symbol $U$
## temperature scales
- we need some observable property that changes predictably with temperature
	- eg: mercury/alcohol based thermometers, thermocouples, infrared measurements, behaviour of ideal gases (using $pV=NRT$)
- ideally, we want a linear dependence of the property on temperature:
	- $X(T)=X_0+cT$
		- where, $X_0=$ value at some temperature, $cT=$ some constant
		- let's use two fixed points:
			- eg:
				- ice point (freezing/melting of pure water)
				- steam point (boiling point of pure water - mix of water/gas)
			- set:
				- ice point $=0\degree C$
				- set steam point $=100\degree C$
			- we can use these two fixed points to calibrate our thermometer

			- $T(X) = 100\frac{X-X_1}{(X_2-X_1)}$
