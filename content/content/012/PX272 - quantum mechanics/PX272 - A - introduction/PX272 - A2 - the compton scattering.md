[[PX156 - A5 - the compton effect| PX156 - quantum phenomena]]
- in experiments with higher energy photons (x-rays), the photons scatter on electrons
- if light is treated as a particle, the change in energy and the wavelength of the photon can be worked out using energy-momentum conservation
$$\lambda'-\lambda = \frac{2\pi\,\hbar}{m_{e}\,c}(1-\cos\theta)$$
	where, $\theta$ is the scattering angle of the photon, and $m_e$ is the mass of an electron
- experiments confirm this behaviour
